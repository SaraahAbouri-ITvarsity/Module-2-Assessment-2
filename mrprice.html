        <p>Mr Price Group Limited, is a publicly traded retail company based in South Africa. Founded in 1985, Mr Price opened in 1987 after the owners bought a controlling interest in John Orrs Holdings, whose trading divisions at the time were The Hub and Miladys. Currently their trading divisions are Mr Price, Miladys, Mr Price Sport, Mr Price Home and Sheet Street. The type of store that I have decided upon is a clothing store. There is about 17 stores in the mall that have to deal with clothing in way or another. But none of these stores offer 3 major brands. The brands are express, gap, and Abercrombie and finch. I will offer these brands. I know hundreds of people who where this clothing. These are some of my favorite brands. I have to drive about 45 minutes away from my house to the Valencia mall just to be able to purchase these brands.  </p>
