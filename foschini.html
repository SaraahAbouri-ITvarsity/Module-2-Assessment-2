        <p>Foschini Group is a South African JSE listed retail clothing group, which trades under various brands and has more than 3,000 stores within its portfolio. The type of store that I have decided upon is a clothing store. There is about 17 stores in the mall that have to deal with clothing in way or another. But none of these stores offer 3 major brands. The brands are express, gap, and Abercrombie and finch. I will offer these brands. I know hundreds of people who where this clothing. These are some of my favorite brands. I have to drive about 45 minutes away from my house to the Valencia mall just to be able to purchase these brands. That's kind of ridiculous. At the same time very annoying. There is hundreds of people who do this where I live. Now when I open this store and begin to start selling these brands, about 75 % of the people are going to come shopping at my store because they now have the product that they love about 5-15 minutes away from them, instead of having there product 45min-1hr.</p>
